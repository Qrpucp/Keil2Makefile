# Keil2Makefile
An automatic script to change a Keil project to Makefile project which uses arm-none-eabi to compile.

Only support STM32F407 series and STM32F405ZGTx. More and more microcontrollers are being supported.

## Usage

Move Keil2Makefile-master to root directory of Keil project, then enter Keil2Makefile-master and run Keil2Makefile.py. 

## TODO

Add support for C99 mode and ```printf``` retarget.
